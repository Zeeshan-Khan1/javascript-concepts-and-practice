# JavaScript Operators

Operators are used for **mathematical** and **logical** computations.

---

## Assignment Operator
The **Assignment Operator** `=` assigns values.

### Example
```js
let x = 10;   // Assign the value 10 to x
let y = 2;    // Assign the value 2 to y
let z = x + y; // Assign the sum of x + y to z

Addition Operator
The Addition Operator + adds numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y; // 7

Multiplication Operator
The Multiplication Operator * multiplies numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y; // 10

Types of JavaScript Operators
JavaScript provides several operator categories:

Arithmetic Operators

Assignment Operators

Comparison Operators

Logical Operators

And more...

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (Power)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

Example
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a; // 450

String Addition
The + operator can also concatenate strings.

Example
Copy code
let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2; // "John Doe"
Using +=
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day"; // "What a very nice day"
Adding Strings and Numbers
Adding two numbers → returns a number.

Adding a number + string → returns a concatenated string.

Example
let x = 5 + 5;       // 10
let y = "5" + 5;     // "55"
let z = "Hello" + 5; // "Hello5"
